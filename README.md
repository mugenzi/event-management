Modern Web Application (MWA) - Final Project
<!-- =================================================== -->
Application specifications and requirements
It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Team leaders will discuss with their team
members an idea and write down a short description for it, set your goals and have a clear scope. Your
project must use the following:
• Implement a login based system (JWT).
• Use UI Kit (Angular material https://material.angular.io or Covalent etc..).
Note: Chat applications are not allowed. Set a more challenging goal

Technical information

• You must use all the technologies we learned in our course (MEAN stack).
• Design your own DB, skeleton and app structure. Start by planning your screens and split your
work between all members. (use DB as a service – Atlas).
• It’s advised that every team member is responsible for implementing one use-case or project
component from start to end.
• All Angular routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)
• All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign up and sign in routes)
• Team leads will create one new Git repo and invite their team members as contributors. All
team members must push to the same repo.
• A daily push is required for each member to track your code and performance. If you miss a
push that will affect your final grade.
• Do not push any private key of any service to Git. (If found, your account will be terminated and
you may be legally sued by service providers). Write your keys in a config file (npm i dotenv) and
add the filename to .gitignore
• Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.
